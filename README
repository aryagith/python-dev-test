This script takes an image, applies transformations, overlays animated captions, generates AI narration, mixes background music, and creates a video with synchronized voiceover and subtitles.

**Requirements**:
-Install Python 3.8+
-Install required libraries:
    ```console
    pip install pillow gtts
    ```
-Install FFmpeg (Required for video & audio processing):
    Windows: Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
    Mac/Linux: Install via package manager or use above link
       ```console
        sudo apt install ffmpeg   # Debian/Ubuntu  
        brew install ffmpeg       # macOS  
       ```

**How to Use**:
-Prepare Assets
    Place your input image (input.jpg) and background music (background.mp3) in the same directory.
    Ensure resources/Roboto-Bold.ttf exists (or update the font path in the script).
    Modify Configuration (Optional):
        Open generate_video.py and update these settings:
      ```python
        **INPUT_IMAGE = "input.jpg"   # Your image file
        BACKGROUND_MUSIC = "background.mp3"  # Background music file
        CAPTION_TEXT = "Hello, this is the Engineering building on my campus."  # Caption to be displayed
        CAPTION_COLOR = "yellow"  # Caption text color (yellow, white, red, etc.)
        FONT_PATH = "resources/Roboto-Bold.ttf"  # Font for captions
        DURATION = 10  # Video duration in seconds**
      ```
-Run the Script
    ```python
    python generate_video.py
    ```
-Output
    The final video will be saved as output.mp4.
    Captions will appear word by word, synced with AI-generated narration.
    The script automatically cleans up temporary files.

**Troubleshooting**:
-FFmpeg Not Found?
    Make sure ffmpeg is installed and accessible from the command line:
    ```console
    ffmpeg -version
    ```
    If not recognized, add it to your system PATH.

-No Audio in Output?
    Ensure your background.mp3 file exists and is not corrupted. Try replacing it with another MP3.

Caption Font Not Found?
    Update FONT_PATH in the script to a valid .ttf font file.
